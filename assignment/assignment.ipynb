Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing? \n",

        "1. The most recent US Census gathered data on race by self-identification. \n",
        "2. We gather this data for resource allocation. This race and ethnicity data helps determine how federal and state funds are distributed for programs like education funding, healthcare services, and infrastructre development. This is important because it also is used during redistricting and representation. The data quality matters to  ensure fair representation and prevent resource misallocation. \n",
        "3. The Census was successful with the multiple response options, allowing respondents to select multiple racial categories. In additon, the multiple data collection options via online, paper, phone, or in-person, reduces the barriers for certain communities. Gender identity questions could be included to add an important dimension of diversity in the population. There should be a redefinition of race and ethnicity to allow for intersectional responses that acknowledge overlapping identities. To increase  responses that are representative, there should be more write-in options in the employment data and education statistics to caputre diverse communities. \n",
        "4. To disclose sex and gender, there was a single binary question regarding sex, with two response options, Male and Female. While this makes it simple and consistent for historical comparisons, it fails to capture information on non-binary, transgender, and gender-diverse populations. Society has changed and the understanding of gender is a lot more inclusive now. The Census should account for these changes. \n",
        "5. It may be difficult to clean characteristic data when it comes to the ethics of categorization. Imposing predefined categories or assumptions can reinforce stereotypes and result in misleading data. With the missing values, they can reflect social or cultural dyanmics with representation. This can lead to bias if respondents are less willing to disclose sensitive information. An example of a good practice is using the \"prefer not to say\" as a  valid responses rather than inferring a value from a name. Bad practices that should be avoided should be inferencing from unreliable attributes like name or pronouns, along with using categories to create distinctions and reinforce bias. \n",
        "6. There can be algorithmic bias when using an algorithm because it is simple to assume and use categories in algorithms. There is high potential for discrimination if users of the data lack awareness and ethical training. Stereotypes will reinforce the algorithmic bias whcih will misclassify the data. "
